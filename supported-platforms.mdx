Previa aggregates market data from multiple prediction market platforms into a single interface. Each platform has different data availability and connection options.

## Kalshi

[Kalshi](https://kalshi.com) is a US-regulated prediction market exchange (CFTC-regulated). Markets cover politics, economics, weather, tech, sports, and more.

**What Previa pulls from Kalshi:**
- Live event and market listings with full metadata
- Real-time YES/NO prices
- 24-hour volume and liquidity
- Historical OHLCV price data (candlesticks)
- Market resolution status and outcome data
- Series and event groupings (markets organized into events)

**Data freshness:** Kalshi data is polled continuously. Prices and volume figures update whenever the poller fetches new data from the Kalshi Trade API.

**Portfolio tracking:** Connect your Kalshi account using your API key and secret to track open positions and P&L. Available on Pro and Premium plans.

## Polymarket

[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) is a decentralized prediction market built on Polygon (an Ethereum Layer 2 network). It is one of the largest prediction markets by volume.

**What Previa pulls from Polymarket:**
- Live event and market listings with full metadata
- Real-time YES/NO prices via the Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) API
- 24-hour volume and liquidity from the Gamma and Data APIs
- Historical price data (OHLCV candlesticks)
- On-chain condition IDs for independent verification

**Data freshness:** Polymarket data is fetched from three separate APIs (Gamma, Data, and CLOB) and merged into a single normalized record per market.

**On-chain verification:** Every Polymarket market has a condition ID — a contract address on the Polygon blockchain. From any market's detail page, click **View on Polygonscan** to inspect the contract directly.

**Portfolio tracking:** Connect your Polymarket wallet address to track positions. Available on Pro and Premium plans.

<Note>
Polymarket portfolio tracking reads positions from the public CLOB API using your wallet address. Full on-chain USDC balance reads are on the roadmap.

## Data normalization

Previa normalizes data from both platforms into a common format:

| Field | Kalshi source | Polymarket source |
|---|---|---|
| YES price | `yes_ask` from Trade API | Best ask from CLOB |
| NO price | `no_ask` from Trade API | Derived from YES price |
| Volume 24h | `volume` (24h window) | `volumeNum` from Gamma API |
| Liquidity | `open_interest` | `liquidityNum` from Gamma API |
| Expires | `close_time` | `endDateIso` |

## Coming soon

Additional platforms are planned for future releases:

| Platform | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Metaculus | Community forecasting | Planned |
| Manifold | Play-money prediction market | Planned |
| PredictIt | Political prediction market | Planned |

Data from new platforms will appear in the same unified market scanner — no configuration needed on your end.
