Once you've [connected an account](/portfolio/connecting-accounts), the **Portfolio** tab shows your positions and performance summary.

## Portfolio summary

At the top of the Portfolio tab, a summary card shows:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total value** | The current market value of all your open positions |
| **Total P&L** | Your overall profit or loss across all positions (dollar amount and percentage) |
| **Position count** | How many open positions you have across all platforms |

## Position list

Below the summary, your positions are grouped by platform (Kalshi, Polymarket). Each position row shows:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Market** | The market question |
| **Side** | Whether you hold YES or NO contracts |
| **Quantity** | Number of contracts |
| **Avg price** | Your average entry price |
| **Current price** | The market's current price |
| **P&L** | Profit or loss on this position (dollar amount) |

Tap a position to go to that market's [detail page](/markets/market-detail).

## Platform breakdown

If you have accounts connected on multiple platforms, the portfolio view shows a breakdown by platform so you can see where your capital is allocated.

## Syncing positions

Positions are automatically synced every 15 minutes. To force an immediate sync:

- **Mobile** — Pull down on the Portfolio tab.
- **Desktop** — Click the refresh button.

After a manual sync, the "Last synced" timestamp updates to confirm the latest data.

## Empty state

If no accounts are linked, the Portfolio tab shows a prompt to connect your first account. Tap the link to go through the [account connection flow](/portfolio/connecting-accounts).

<Note>
Portfolio tracking is available on **Pro**, **Premium**, and **Institutional** plans. Free users see the empty state with a prompt to upgrade.
