Previa can sync your prediction market positions from Kalshi and Polymarket, giving you a unified portfolio view with P&L tracking. Portfolio tracking is available on **Pro**, **Premium**, and **Institutional** plans.

## Connecting Kalshi

Kalshi uses API credentials for account linking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate API credentials on Kalshi">
    1. Log in to [kalshi.com](https://kalshi.com).
    2. Go to **Account** → **Security** → **API Keys**.
    3. Click **Generate API Key**.
    4. Copy the **API Key** (a UUID string) and download the **RSA Private Key** (PEM file).

    <Warning>
    Store your private key securely. It cannot be retrieved after you leave the page. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new key pair.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter credentials in Previa">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Linked Accounts** (or **Portfolio** → **Link Account**).
    2. Select **Kalshi**.
    3. Paste your **API Key** and **API Secret** (the private key content).
    4. Tap **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Previa validates your credentials by checking your Kalshi account balance. If successful, the connection shows as **Active** and your positions begin syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your Kalshi credentials are encrypted before storage and are only used to read your positions. Previa never places trades on your behalf.

## Connecting Polymarket

Polymarket uses your wallet address for position tracking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your Polymarket wallet address">
    Your Polymarket wallet address is the Ethereum/Polygon address you use to trade on Polymarket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your wallet address in Previa">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Linked Accounts** (or **Portfolio** → **Link Account**).
    2. Select **Polymarket**.
    3. Enter your wallet address.
    4. Tap **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Previa validates the address and fetches your positions from Polymarket's public API. If positions are found, the connection shows as **Active**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Polymarket position tracking uses public CLOB API data. Full on-chain USDC position reads and more granular P&L calculations are on the roadmap.
</Note>

## Connection status

Each connected account shows a status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Credentials are valid, positions are syncing |
| **Invalid** | Credentials are no longer valid (e.g., API key revoked). Reconnect with new credentials. |
| **Disconnected** | You manually disconnected the account |

## Disconnecting an account

Go to **Settings** → **Linked Accounts**, select the platform, and tap **Disconnect**. Your stored credentials are deleted immediately. Historical position data is retained in your account until you [request data deletion](/account/data-privacy).

## Sync frequency

Positions sync automatically every 15 minutes. You can force a manual sync from the Portfolio tab by pulling down to refresh.
