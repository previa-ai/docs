You can change your plan at any time from the app.

## Upgrading

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open subscription settings">
    Go to **Settings** → **Organization** → **Billing** (if you're in an organization) or **Settings** → **Subscription**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a plan">
    Review the available plans and tap **Upgrade** on the one you want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete payment">
    You'll be directed to a secure checkout page to enter your payment information. On mobile, this opens in your device's browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Once payment is processed, your plan upgrades immediately. New features are available right away — no sign-out required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Payment processing is handled by Stripe. Previa does not store your credit card details directly.
</Note>

## Downgrading

To move to a lower-tier plan:

1. Go to your subscription settings.
2. Select the plan you want to switch to.
3. Confirm the change.

Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing period. You keep access to your current plan's features until then.

If you downgrade and exceed the new plan's limits (e.g., more than 3 watchlist items on Free), you won't lose your data, but you won't be able to add new items until you're within the limit.

## Billing

Your subscription renews monthly on the same date you subscribed. You can view billing history and update your payment method in **Settings** → **Organization** → **Billing**.

| Action | Where |
|---|---|
| View current plan | Settings → Subscription or Organization → Billing |
| Update payment method | Settings → Organization → Billing |
| View billing history | Settings → Organization → Billing |
| Cancel subscription | Settings → Subscription → Cancel |

## Canceling

When you cancel a paid subscription:

1. You keep access to paid features until the end of your current billing period.
2. At the end of the period, your account reverts to the Free plan.
3. Data is not deleted — your watchlist, alerts, and portfolio connections remain, but features gated to paid plans become inaccessible.

<Note>
Stripe integration for subscription management is coming soon. Plan definitions are available in the app, and payment processing will be enabled in an upcoming release.
