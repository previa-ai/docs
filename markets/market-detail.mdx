## Price chart

Below the stats, a line chart shows historical price movement. Select a time range to adjust the view:

Touch or hover over the chart to see a crosshair with the exact price and timestamp at that point.

## AI intelligence panel

Below the chart, the AI panel shows Previa's analysis:

- **Confidence score** — A 0-100 score displayed in a circular ring. Color-coded: green (70+), yellow (40-69), red (below 40).
- **Score breakdown** — How much each signal contributed to the overall score.
- **AI reasoning** — A 2-3 sentence explanation of why the AI rates the market at this level.

<Note>
Score breakdowns and AI reasoning are available on **Pro** and **Premium** plans. Free users see the composite score but not the detailed breakdown. A paywall overlay shows what you'd unlock by upgrading.
</Note>

### Score components

The confidence score is built from these weighted signals:

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Market price | 40% | Current price and recent price trajectory |
| News | 25% | Relevance and sentiment of matched news articles |
| Social sentiment | 15% | Aggregate sentiment from X, Reddit, and Telegram |
| Historical patterns | 15% | How similar markets have resolved in the past |
| Time decay | 5% | How close the market is to resolution |

See [how scoring works](/intelligence/how-scoring-works) for the full methodology.
