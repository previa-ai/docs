Select any market in the scanner to open its detail page. This page gives you a complete view of the market and the intelligence behind it.

## Price and stats

At the top of the page:

- **Market question** — The full prediction being traded.
- **YES price** — The current cost of a YES contract (color-coded: green when above 60¢, red when below 40¢).
- **NO price** — The current cost of a NO contract.
- **Volume 24h** — Trading volume over the past 24 hours.
- **Liquidity** — Capital available in the order book.
- **Expires** — Countdown to market resolution.
- **Last updated** — When the data was most recently fetched from the platform.
- **Platform, status, and category badges** — Which exchange, current market state, and topic.

## Event context

If the market belongs to a multi-outcome event (e.g., "Who wins the 2026 election?" with one market per candidate), a banner at the top links to the parent event. You can also see other outcomes in the same event — each shows its current YES price so you can compare probabilities across the set.

## Price chart

Below the stats, a line chart shows historical price movement. Previa fetches OHLCV candlestick data from each platform:

| 6H | Last 6 hours |

| 1W | Last 7 days |
