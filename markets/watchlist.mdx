Your watchlist is a personal collection of markets you want to keep an eye on. Saved markets appear in the **Watchlist** segment on the Markets tab for quick access.

## Adding markets to your watchlist

There are two ways to save a market:

1. **From the market detail page** — Tap the heart icon in the actions row. The icon fills in to confirm it's saved.
2. **Long-press on a market card** — On mobile, long-press any card in the market scanner for a quick-action menu that includes "Add to watchlist."

## Viewing your watchlist

On the Markets tab, tap the **Watchlist** segment at the top (next to "All Markets"). This view shows only your saved markets, sorted by when you added them.

Your watchlist items include the same data as the main scanner — live prices, 24h change, volume, and AI scores — so you can monitor everything from one view.

## Removing markets

To remove a market from your watchlist:

1. Open the market detail page.
2. Tap the filled heart icon. It reverts to an outline, confirming removal.

The market is removed from your Watchlist view immediately.

## Watchlist limits

If you're on the Free plan and have 3 markets saved, you'll need to remove one before adding another, or [upgrade your plan](/plans/upgrading).
