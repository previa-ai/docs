The **Markets** tab is the main screen of Previa. It shows live prediction markets from supported platforms in a single, searchable list.

## The market scanner

Each market card shows:

- **Question** — The prediction being traded (e.g., "Will Bitcoin exceed $100K by March 2026?")
- **YES / NO price** — Current market odds displayed as a price bar (e.g., 72% YES / 28% NO)
- **Platform badge** — Which exchange the market is on (Kalshi or Polymarket)
- **Category badge** — The topic area (Politics, Crypto, Economics, etc.)
- **24h change** — How much the price has moved in the last 24 hours
- **Volume** — Total trading volume
- **AI score** — The Previa confidence score (0-100), if available

Tap any card to open the [market detail page](/markets/market-detail).
