The **Markets** tab shows live prediction markets from supported platforms in a single, searchable list. Markets update continuously as data is polled from each platform.

## What each market shows

Each market entry displays:

- **Question** — The prediction being traded (e.g., "Will Bitcoin exceed $100K by March 2026?")
- **YES / NO price** — Current market odds (e.g., 72¢ YES means a 72% implied probability)
- **Platform badge** — Which exchange the market is on (Kalshi or Polymarket)
- **Category** — The topic area (Politics, Crypto, Economics, etc.)
- **24h volume** — Trading volume over the past 24 hours
- **Liquidity** — Capital available in the order book
- **Status** — Whether the market is open, closed, or resolved
- **Expires** — When the market closes for trading
- **Last updated** — How recently the data was fetched from the platform
- **AI score** — The Previa confidence score (0–100), if available

Select any market to open its [detail page](/markets/market-detail).
