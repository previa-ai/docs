Alerts notify you when a market hits a condition you define — a price target, a score shift, breaking news, or a volume spike. You choose the market, the trigger, and how you want to be notified.

## Creating an alert

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the alert creation form">
    You can create an alert from two places:
    - **Alerts tab** → tap **Create Alert** at the top.
    - **Market detail page** → tap the **Create Alert** button in the actions row. The market is pre-filled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a market">
    If you didn't come from a market detail page, search for and select the market you want to monitor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a trigger type">
    Pick what condition should fire the alert:
    - **Price threshold** — When the price goes above or below a value you set.
    - **Score shift** — When the AI confidence score changes by a specified amount.
    - **News catalyst** — When a high-impact news article is matched to the market.
    - **Volume spike** — When trading volume surges above its recent baseline.

    See [alert types](/alerts/alert-types) for details on configuring each trigger.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select delivery channels">
    Choose how you want to be notified:
    - **Push notification** — Sent to your phone or browser (requires notification permissions).
    - **Email** — Sent to your account email.
    - **In-app** — Appears in the Alerts tab with an unread badge.

    You can enable multiple channels for the same alert.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the alert">
    Tap **Create**. The alert starts monitoring immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing alerts

### Viewing alerts

The **Alerts** tab shows two things:

1. **Alert events** — Notifications from alerts that have fired. New events show an unread dot.
2. **Alert rules** — Your configured alert rules and their status.

### Editing an alert

Tap an alert rule to open it. You can change the trigger conditions, delivery channels, or pause it.

### Pausing and resuming

You can pause an alert rule without deleting it. Paused alerts stop evaluating until you resume them.

### Deleting an alert

Swipe left on an alert rule (mobile) or use the delete option to remove it permanently.

## Alert limits

| Plan | Alert limit |
|---|---|
| Free | 5 alerts |
| Pro | 50 alerts |
| Premium | Unlimited |
| Institutional | Unlimited |

Alerts are also rate-limited to **20 notifications per day** per account to prevent notification fatigue.

## How alerts are evaluated

Previa evaluates your alert rules periodically. When a rule's conditions are met:

1. A notification is created and delivered via your selected channels.
2. The alert event appears in your Alerts tab.
3. If you set a max trigger count, it's decremented.
4. If the alert has an expiration date and it's passed, the alert is set to expired.
