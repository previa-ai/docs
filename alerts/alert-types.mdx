Previa supports four types of alert triggers. Each monitors a different aspect of a market.

## Price threshold

Fires when a market's price crosses a value you define.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Side | Which price to monitor: **YES** or **NO** |
| Direction | **Above**, **Below**, or **Crosses** (fires in either direction) |
| Threshold | The price value (0.01 to 0.99) that triggers the alert |

**Example:** Alert me when the YES price goes above 0.75 on "Will Bitcoin exceed $100K?"

**When to use:** You have a specific entry or exit price in mind and want to know when the market reaches it.

## Score shift

Fires when the AI confidence score changes by a specified amount between scoring cycles.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Delta threshold | Minimum score change to trigger (e.g., 10 points) |
| Direction | **Up** (score increased), **Down** (score decreased), or **Any** |

**Example:** Alert me when the confidence score on any watchlisted market drops by 15 or more points.

**When to use:** You want to catch significant changes in the AI's assessment, which often correspond to breaking news or sentiment shifts.

<Tip>
Score alerts are evaluated every 10 minutes (the scoring cycle interval). Set a delta of at least 5 to avoid noise from minor fluctuations.

## News catalyst

Fires when a news article matching a high impact threshold is linked to the market.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Impact level | **High**, **Medium**, or **Any** |

**Example:** Alert me when high-impact news is matched to my watchlisted political markets.

**When to use:** You want to be the first to know when relevant news breaks that could move the market.

## Volume spike

Fires when the market's 24-hour trading volume exceeds a multiple of its recent baseline.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Multiplier | How many times the baseline volume must be exceeded (e.g., 2x, 3x, 5x) |
| Lookback days | Number of days used to calculate the baseline average (default: 7) |

**Example:** Alert me when volume on "Fed rate decision" is 3x its 7-day average.

**When to use:** Volume spikes often precede or accompany significant price moves. This alert catches unusual trading activity.

## Optional settings for all alert types

These settings apply to any alert type:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Max triggers | Maximum number of times the alert can fire before auto-pausing. Leave blank for unlimited. |
| Expiration | A date after which the alert automatically expires. Useful for time-bound markets. |
| Channels | Push, email, in-app — select one or more. |
