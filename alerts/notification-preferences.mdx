Previa delivers notifications through three channels: push notifications, email, and in-app. You control which channels are active and what types of notifications you receive.

## Notification channels

### Push notifications

Push notifications are sent to your phone (iOS/Android) or browser. To receive them:

1. Allow notification permissions when prompted by the app.
2. Previa automatically registers your device when you sign in.

If you denied permissions, you can re-enable them in your device's settings for the Previa app.

### Email notifications

Email notifications are sent to your account email address. They're used for:

- Alert triggers (if you enabled email as a delivery channel for that alert)
- Account security events (MFA changes, password resets)
- Billing-related updates (if on a paid plan)

### In-app notifications

Every notification appears in the **Alerts** tab regardless of your other channel settings. The tab badge shows your unread count.

## Managing preferences

Go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Notification Preferences** to control notification categories:

| Category | What it covers | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Billing | Payment confirmations, subscription changes, invoices | On |
| Marketing | Product updates, feature announcements, tips | Off |
| API status | Service status updates and maintenance notices | On |
| Organization alerts | Team activity: new members, role changes, invitations | On |

These categories control email delivery. Push notifications are governed by your individual alert rules (each alert specifies its own delivery channels).

## Marking notifications as read

In the Alerts tab:

- **Tap a notification** to mark it as read and view details.
- **Swipe left** (mobile) to dismiss and mark as read.
- **Mark all read** — Tap the "Mark all read" button in the header to clear all unread indicators.

## Unread badge

The Alerts tab shows a badge with the count of unread notifications. This count is synced across devices — marking a notification as read on one device clears it everywhere.
