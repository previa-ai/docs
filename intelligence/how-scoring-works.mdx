Previa's scoring engine runs every 10 minutes across all active markets. It combines five data signals into a single 0-100 composite score.

## The five scoring components

### 1. Market price signal (40% weight)

The largest component. The scoring engine analyzes:

- **Current price** — Where the YES/NO contract is trading right now
- **Price momentum** — Direction and velocity of recent price movement
- **Price trajectory** — Whether the trend is accelerating, decelerating, or reversing

This captures what the market's collective intelligence is pricing in.

### 2. News signal (25% weight)

Previa ingests news articles from multiple sources and maps them to markets using AI:

1. **Ingestion** — Articles are fetched from news providers every 15 minutes, deduplicated, and stored.
2. **Analysis** — Each article is analyzed by an AI model (Claude) for topic, sentiment, and potential market impact.
3. **Matching** — Articles are matched to relevant markets using semantic similarity (OpenAI embeddings). An article must exceed a 0.7 similarity threshold to be mapped.
4. **Scoring** — The aggregate sentiment and impact of matched articles feeds into the market's score.

### 3. Social sentiment (15% weight)

<Note>
The social intelligence layer is being expanded. Sentiment data is currently available for markets with active social discussion. Coverage will grow as more sources are integrated.
</Note>

Social sentiment is gathered from X (Twitter), Reddit, and Telegram. The engine calculates:

- **Weighted sentiment** — Each post is scored for sentiment, weighted by the source's credibility
- **Rolling windows** — Sentiment is aggregated over 1-hour, 6-hour, and 24-hour windows
- **Anomaly detection** — Sudden sentiment shifts or volume spikes are flagged

### 4. Historical patterns (15% weight)

For markets with enough historical data, the engine compares:

- **Similar resolved markets** — How markets with comparable characteristics resolved
- **Category trends** — How markets in the same category tend to behave

This component strengthens over time as more markets resolve and the dataset grows.

### 5. Time decay (5% weight)

As a market approaches its resolution date, the time decay factor increases. This reflects the narrowing window for price movement and the increasing weight of existing evidence.

## Score calculation

Each component produces a sub-score from 0 to 100. The composite score is the weighted sum:

```
composite = (price × 0.40) + (news × 0.25) + (social × 0.15) + (historical × 0.15) + (decay × 0.05)
```

The result is rounded to the nearest integer.

## AI reasoning

When a market's score changes by 5 or more points between cycles, the scoring engine generates a natural-language explanation using Claude. This reasoning:

- Identifies which component(s) drove the change
- Summarizes the key evidence (news articles, price movements, sentiment shifts)
- Provides context for why the score moved

Reasoning is available to **Pro** and **Premium** users on the market detail page.

## Score alerts

When a score changes by more than 10 points in a single cycle, a **score alert** is generated. You can subscribe to these alerts for specific markets. See [alert types](/alerts/alert-types#score-shift).

## Limitations

- Scores reflect the data available to Previa at scoring time. They do not account for insider information or events that haven't been reported.
- The social component depends on public discussion volume. Low-profile markets may have limited social signal.
- Historical comparisons are strongest for categories with many resolved markets (politics, economics) and weakest for novel or one-off events.
- Scores are analytical signals, not trade recommendations.
