description: "How the Insights tab works and what each AI insight tells you about a market."
---

The **Insights** tab shows AI-generated analysis for prediction markets where Previa has detected meaningful signals. Each insight connects a confidence score to the news, sentiment, and market data that produced it.

## What is an insight

An insight is generated when a market's scoring cycle produces notable results — a significant score, a shift from a previous cycle, or a strong news catalyst. Each insight includes:

- **Headline** — AI-generated summary of the key finding
- **Market link** — The market the insight relates to, with current YES price
- **Confidence score** — The AI's 0-100 rating
- **Direction** — Bullish, bearish, or neutral signal
- **Evidence** — Key news sources or data points that contributed to the analysis
- **Platform badge** — Which exchange hosts the market

## Filtering insights

Use the controls at the top of the Insights tab:

### Segments
- **For You** — Insights filtered by your selected interest categories (chosen during onboarding or in Settings). Prioritizes markets in topics you care about.
- **All** — Every available insight across all categories.

### Filters
- **Category** — Show insights for specific topics (Politics, Crypto, Sports, etc.)
- **Type** — Filter by signal direction:
  - **Bullish** — AI sees positive momentum or supporting evidence
  - **Bearish** — AI sees negative momentum or opposing evidence
  - **Neutral** — Mixed signals or insufficient data for a directional call

## Featured insights

The first item in the feed is a **featured insight** — a larger card highlighting the most significant current analysis. This is selected based on score magnitude, recent change, and trading volume.

## Free plan limits

On the **Free** plan, you see **1 AI insight per day**. The remaining insights are blurred with an upgrade prompt.

On **Pro** and **Premium** plans, you see unlimited insights plus the full score breakdown and reasoning for each one.

## From insight to action

Each insight card includes a **View Market** link that takes you directly to the [market detail page](/markets/market-detail), where you can:

- See the full price chart
- Read the complete score breakdown (Pro/Premium)
- Add the market to your watchlist
- Set an alert
- Trade on the source platform
